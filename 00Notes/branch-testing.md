# Trying out branches
created a new markdown file to learn how to switch between and merge branches. 

* to create a new branch:
"git checkout -b new-branch-name"

* to switch between branches:
"git checkout branch-to-switch-to

* to see all branches:
"git branch" 
the current branch will be highlighted and starred.
